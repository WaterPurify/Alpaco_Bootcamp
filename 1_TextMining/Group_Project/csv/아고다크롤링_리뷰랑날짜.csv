"Is it necessary to write a review for this hotel?”
They upgraded my room so I decided to write a review haha. This is the best hotel that everyone in Korea knows about, with service and facilities that match its reputation. The staff are friendly (even though I checked in late, I still got a room upgrade) and the interior design turns the old into vintage, but it's not outdated at all. During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip. Even if there are many new and good hotels, Shilla is definitely the best in Jeju. I plan to go again next year... I need to make more money...",Stayed 2 nights in November 2023
"As expected, Shilla is Shilla!! Adding the evening view at The Parkview made it completely satisfying.”
During the room change, the female staff member who helped us was very kind and helpful. Unfortunately, we couldn't see her name because her jacket was covering it. She was really great! All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new. We have stayed at Shilla Hotel many times, but we have never seen anyone who was unresponsive. Overall, we are satisfied and will come back again!",Stayed 1 night in November 2023
"Exellent Location & Service”
We stayed at Shilla Jeju for 3 days. The location is excellent, they have many restaurants and shops near by, easy and free parking on site. Also the staff at the hotel provides excellent services. This property is really big, has adult only pool, hiking course along the cliff with amazing ocean view, gramping site and more! Highly recommend this hotel!",Stayed 3 nights in October 2023
"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023
"완벽산 신라호텔 경험”
가든뷰에 17개월 아기와 함께 묵었습니다. 비록 저녁에 윗층에서 소란이 있기는 했지만 신라호텔에 지불하는 비용은 최신시설이 아닌 스테프들의 서비스와 경험을 사는것을 느꼈던 여행이였습니다. 왜 내가 이런 운이 없는 방을 받았을까? 라는 감정에서 신라호텔을 왔기때문에 이런 경험도 하는구나 로 바뀌는 순간이였습니다. 다시한번 놀라운 경험을 도와주신 지배인님과 모든 스텝분들께 우리 가족은 감사를 표합니다.",Stayed 1 night in September 2023

"Worth every penny”
Room is spacious, clean and neat. Every staff was so kind and willing to help that you don’t really need to ask for a help(because they ask if you need help before you ask them for a help) Facilities are also clean and luxurious.

"Hands down the best accomms in Jeju”
The best hotel in the area if not the entirety of Jeju. Even as a Korean this was a mindblowing hotel. Loved the garden and seafront walkway especially. Go for the better rooms because they are worth it! My only complaint is the lack of food options nearby but you can get stuff delivered using food delivery apps or order room service (I heard the portions were huge)",Stayed 2 nights in June 2023

"Not worth the valuer”
Parking space is unbelievably too tight, there is no room to open either passenger or driver doors. The space that was meant to be for two cars, they split into three. The room furniture shows age but otherwise in decent shape. Dining/restaurant is not worth the price but average enough if you really dont have other options. The room door knobs seem worn-out and loose at times.",Stayed 1 night in March 2024

"Too old and expensive ”
Shilla Jeju hotel has a nice swimming pool and well maintained. However, the room was old fashioned and the price of the room is ripped off as considering of the condition. The breakfast and the restaurant foods are also very expensive. So if you do care about the swimming pool, it is ok to stay but I'm not sure if it is worth it.",Stayed 2 nights in January 2024

Pros: Heated pool, live band by the pool, beautiful landscape on a small cliff over Jungnum beach, peaceful, helpful staff, big room.

"A Samsung Hotel”
Samsung runs four hotels under the Shilla name. As beautiful as the main interiors were, there were major issues. The hallways smelled like moldy straw all the time (4 nights) we were there. The beds were uncomfortable. Food/drinks were very expensive--French fries cost about $36 and my mojito $26 served at the indoor/outdoor pool filled with very young children (pee & poo pool). I think their hotels are for employees who may be getting discounts, not for tourists.",Stayed 3 nights in June 2018

There was lots of programs for children so parents with children can stay more easy.",Stayed 2 nights in September 2016
"Caveat Emptor!”
This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

INTERIOR, STAFF PERFORMANCE, HIGH CLASS
If you want to stay in Jeju for very special holiday, Shilla will be the best choice. Of course it costs a lot but your time in this hotle will be invaluable. What I loved the most was their warm and romantic interior. Pastel toned interior is truly warm and romantic. The room was confortable and its bathroom was also very classy.

Comfort, facilities and luxurious.
This is by far the best hotel I've stayed in my life. I've booked for 3 ocean view rooms for 2 nights. I never wanted to leave the hotel. The bed was perfect and bathroom was compatibly awesome. The view is priceless, especially in the morning. They could've hired a better live band though, but the overall concept of this hotel is just pure luxury. Don't forget to check out the camping site while you're there. Though it's leaning on the pricey side, this is the kind of hotel that is worth the try and money.

"Discriminated hotel policy... expensive but nice”
Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all. I feel offended and robbed as the experience is not at all in line with the expectation the name Shilla is brining. Overall, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the same area which might offered better values.",Stayed 1 night in March 2014

It was relaxing and nice. The hotel is expensive and upscale. We have not used any facilities but had their breakfast buffet as everyone was praising about their breakfast.

Amenities
When we first arrived, we had the ""wow"" type of welcome from the reception. But as we move to our rooms, we were a bit disappointed. Didn't had the ""wow"" effect when we first walked in to the room. In fact, it looked ordinary and very wooden. Definitely not worth the price plus the fact that I paid about $ per night with no breakfast! Bed was hard. They provided enough pillows. Free wifi.

"service was fine but doesn't worth at all”
bed is comfortable and room is clean
well they have good service in general, and room is pretty clean, i love the little gift such like a box of pencil from them, seems pretty warm. however, i have to point out that 1. room service sucks,house keeping opened my door without my permission for two times to check if i'm in the room!! thats so rude! i know i should check out on time, but is just not polite to open the door when i was still in the room and i already told her i will check out in 5 mins! 2. hotel is too far away from the city center. 3. compare with other hotels, this hotel absolutely sucks! room is soo small and no english channel in tv! no hbo! i was really disappointed! btw, mountain view sucks.. don't live in a mountain view room, trust me....",Stayed 2 nights in January 2012

lujo, bellos paisajes, bien situado al sur de la isla
El hotel es uno de los mejores de la isla, situado en la zona sur en un complejo de hoteles con todas las comodidades. Solo eche en falta que en el precio de la habitación incluyeran el desayuno, aunque no hay problema para salir del hotel y encontrar cafeterías y restaurantes. Es recomendable llevar coche alquilado.",Stayed 3 nights in March 2013
"Parfait mais vieillot”
Bel établissement. Immense. Service impeccable. Maintenance parfaite. Mais prestations hors de prix et besoin de rénovation car hold fashion. Le petit déjeuner à 49,000 KRW (330 HKD, 295 RMB, 38 EUR ou 42 USD) ne passe pas... Un petit déjeuner plus cher que dans le plus cher des Four Seasons me semble tout simplement être abusif. Suffisamment pour m'avoir enlever l'envie d'utiliser les prestations de l'hôtel. L'effet marketing à l'envers. Je crois que c'est la première fois de ma vie où je fuie l'hôtel où je réside pour me réfugier chez Starbusck plutôt que d'apprécier la générosité et l'abondance du petit déjeuner de l'hôtel... Domage car l'hôtel est parfaitement géré, le personnel très professionnellent formé (un point spécial à l'exceptionnel personnel de conciergerie) et l'entretien et la maintenance d'un rare niveau de qualité. La politique de prix est juste d'un autre monde et, jugement de professionnel, d'une autre catégorie d'hôtel. Shilla est un resort de haut de gamme mais t",Stayed 4 nights in October 2019

"Is it necessary to write a review for this hotel?”
They upgraded my room so I decided to write a review haha. This is the best hotel that everyone in Korea knows about, with service and facilities that match its reputation. The staff are friendly (even though I checked in late, I still got a room upgrade) and the interior design turns the old into vintage, but it's not outdated at all. During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip. Even if there are many new and good hotels, Shilla is definitely the best in Jeju. I plan to go again next year... I need to make more money...",Stayed 2 nights in November 2023
"As expected, Shilla is Shilla!! Adding the evening view at The Parkview made it completely satisfying.”
During the room change, the female staff member who helped us was very kind and helpful. Unfortunately, we couldn't see her name because her jacket was covering it. She was really great! All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new. We have stayed at Shilla Hotel many times, but we have never seen anyone who was unresponsive. Overall, we are satisfied and will come back again!",Stayed 1 night in November 2023

"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

Parking space is unbelievably too tight, there is no room to open either passenger or driver doors. The space that was meant to be for two cars, they split into three.

"Caveat Emptor!”
This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all.

Beautiful manicured gardens probably larger than the hotel itself. Lovely for evening walks and a gorgeous view of the sea from the edge of the garden. The swimming pool area is full of constant activities late into the night with salsa dances and suprano singers entertaining guests at all times Rooms were clean and spacious. Embodies rest and relax, definitely does not feel as commercial as some other resorts along the same strip. Pricey but definitely the best resort to stay in jeju.",Stayed 3 nights in September 2012
"Gorgeous hotel, helpful staff, easy beach access”
Heated indoor and outdoor pool, multiple jacuzzi, modern fitness center, centrally located.
It was a pleasure to stay at this hotel. I received a complimentary upgrade to one of the newer rooms in the new addition to the hotel. The photographs don't exaggerate when you walk around the hotel, everything really is that beautiful. I would easily stay here again if finding my way through Jeju island.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2012
"Well-appointed rooms and self-contained resort”
Very comfortable room and beautiful garden
The hotel grounds are well taken care of. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The location is far away from the central but right on the beach. It is very relaxing to just walk around the garden and beach. We were happy with enjoying the hotel facilities. The grounds are inter-linked to Lotte Hotel, which is great as it offers the guests more choices in terms of venues to eat.",Stayed 1 night in October 2012

"Nice Hotel but a bit disappointed”
Amenities
When we first arrived, we had the ""wow"" type of welcome from the reception. But as we move to our rooms, we were a bit disappointed. Didn't had the ""wow"" effect when we first walked in to the room. In fact, it looked ordinary and very wooden. Definitely not worth the price plus the fact that I paid about $ per night with no breakfast! Bed was hard. They provided enough pillows. Free wifi. We booked this hotel thinking of renting a car, but realised that need international license to rent, ended up we did not rent any car and we became not very mobile.",Stayed 2 nights in April 2012

bed is comfortable and room is clean
well they have good service in general, and room is pretty clean, i love the little gift such like a box of pencil from them, seems pretty warm. however, i have to point out that 1. room service sucks,house keeping opened my door without my permission for two times to check if i'm in the room!! thats so rude! i know i should check out on time, but is just not polite to open the door when i was still in the room and i already told her i will check out in 5 mins! 2. hotel is too far away from the city center. 3. compare with other hotels, this hotel absolutely sucks! room is soo small and no english channel in tv! no hbo! i was really disappointed! btw, mountain view sucks.. don't live in a mountain view room, trust me....",Stayed 2 nights in January 2012

Bel établissement. Immense. Service impeccable. Maintenance parfaite. Mais prestations hors de prix et besoin de rénovation car hold fashion. Le petit déjeuner à 49,000 KRW (330 HKD, 295 RMB, 38 EUR ou 42 USD) ne passe pas... Un petit déjeuner plus cher que dans le plus cher des Four Seasons me semble tout simplement être abusif. Suffisamment pour m'avoir enlever l'envie d'utiliser les prestations de l'hôtel. L'effet marketing à l'envers. Je crois que c'est la première fois de ma vie où je fuie l'hôtel où je réside pour me réfugier chez Starbusck plutôt que d'apprécier la générosité et l'abondance du petit déjeuner de l'hôtel... Domage car l'hôtel est parfaitement géré, le personnel très professionnellent formé (un point spécial à l'exceptionnel personnel de conciergerie) et l'entretien et la maintenance d'un rare niveau de qualité.

"Is it necessary to write a review for this hotel?”
They upgraded my room so I decided to write a review haha. This is the best hotel that everyone in Korea knows about, with service and facilities that match its reputation. The staff are friendly (even though I checked in late, I still got a room upgrade) and the interior design turns the old into vintage, but it's not outdated at all. During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip. Even if there are many new and good hotels, Shilla is definitely the best in Jeju. I plan to go again next year... I need to make more money...",Stayed 2 nights in November 2023
"As expected, Shilla is Shilla!! Adding the evening view at The Parkview made it completely satisfying.”
During the room change, the female staff member who helped us was very kind and helpful. Unfortunately, we couldn't see her name because her jacket was covering it. She was really great! All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new. We have stayed at Shilla Hotel many times, but we have never seen anyone who was unresponsive. Overall, we are satisfied and will come back again!",Stayed 1 night in November 2023

"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

Parking space is unbelievably too tight, there is no room to open either passenger or driver doors. The space that was meant to be for two cars, they split into three.

This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

"Discriminated hotel policy... expensive but nice”
Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all.

Everything was great! It was delightful stay. But the mountain view was actually like car park view, so we had to upgrade our room to ocean view. Except this everything was good as thier reputation.

Amenities
When we first arrived, we had the ""wow"" type of welcome from the reception. But as we move to our rooms, we were a bit disappointed. Didn't had the ""wow"" effect when we first walked in to the room. In fact, it looked ordinary and very wooden. Definitely not worth the price plus the fact that I paid about $ per night with no breakfast! Bed was hard. They provided enough pillows. Free wifi. We booked this hotel thinking of renting a car, but realised that need international license to rent, ended up we did not rent any car and we became not very mobile.",Stayed 2 nights in April 2012

well they have good service in general, and room is pretty clean, i love the little gift such like a box of pencil from them, seems pretty warm. however, i have to point out that 1. room service sucks,house keeping opened my door without my permission for two times to check if i'm in the room!! thats so rude! i know i should check out on time, but is just not polite to open the door when i was still in the room and i already told her i will check out in 5 mins! 2. hotel is too far away from the city center. 3. compare with other hotels, this hotel absolutely sucks! room is soo small and no english channel in tv! no hbo! i was really disappointed! btw, mountain view sucks.. don't live in a mountain view room, trust me....",Stayed 2 nights in January 2012

Bel établissement. Immense. Service impeccable. Maintenance parfaite. Mais prestations hors de prix et besoin de rénovation car hold fashion. Le petit déjeuner à 49,000 KRW (330 HKD, 295 RMB, 38 EUR ou 42 USD) ne passe pas... Un petit déjeuner plus cher que dans le plus cher des Four Seasons me semble tout simplement être abusif. Suffisamment pour m'avoir enlever l'envie d'utiliser les prestations de l'hôtel. L'effet marketing à l'envers. Je crois que c'est la première fois de ma vie où je fuie l'hôtel où je réside pour me réfugier chez Starbusck plutôt que d'apprécier la générosité et l'abondance du petit déjeuner de l'hôtel... Domage car l'hôtel est parfaitement géré, le personnel très professionnellent formé (un point spécial à l'exceptionnel personnel de conciergerie) et l'entretien et la maintenance d'un rare niveau de qualité.

"Is it necessary to write a review for this hotel?”
They upgraded my room so I decided to write a review haha. This is the best hotel that everyone in Korea knows about, with service and facilities that match its reputation. The staff are friendly (even though I checked in late, I still got a room upgrade) and the interior design turns the old into vintage, but it's not outdated at all. During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip. Even if there are many new and good hotels, Shilla is definitely the best in Jeju. I plan to go again next year... I need to make more money...",Stayed 2 nights in November 2023

During the room change, the female staff member who helped us was very kind and helpful. Unfortunately, we couldn't see her name because her jacket was covering it. She was really great! All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new. We have stayed at Shilla Hotel many times, but we have never seen anyone who was unresponsive. Overall, we are satisfied and will come back again!",Stayed 1 night in November 2023

"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

Parking space is unbelievably too tight, there is no room to open either passenger or driver doors. The space that was meant to be for two cars, they split into three.

This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

"Discriminated hotel policy... expensive but nice”
Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all. I feel offended and robbed as the experience is not at all in line with the expectation the name Shilla is brining. Overall, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the same area which might offered better values.",Stayed 1 night in March 2014
"Luxury Hotel but still not worth of Money”
Friendly Staff, Elegant Lobby, and Nice Swimming Pools
It was relaxing and nice. The hotel is expensive and upscale. We have not used any facilities but had their breakfast buffet as everyone was praising about their breakfast. The food was good quality but we were disappointed with the food selection. I still thinks it is not worth of money, comparing to other hotels in Jeju.",Stayed 1 night in January 2014

Amenities
When we first arrived, we had the ""wow"" type of welcome from the reception. But as we move to our rooms, we were a bit disappointed. Didn't had the ""wow"" effect when we first walked in to the room. In fact, it looked ordinary and very wooden. Definitely not worth the price plus the fact that I paid about $ per night with no breakfast! Bed was hard. They provided enough pillows. Free wifi.

Bel établissement. Immense. Service impeccable. Maintenance parfaite. Mais prestations hors de prix et besoin de rénovation car hold fashion. Le petit déjeuner à 49,000 KRW (330 HKD, 295 RMB, 38 EUR ou 42 USD) ne passe pas... Un petit déjeuner plus cher que dans le plus cher des Four Seasons me semble tout simplement être abusif. Suffisamment pour m'avoir enlever l'envie d'utiliser les prestations de l'hôtel. L'effet marketing à l'envers. Je crois que c'est la première fois de ma vie où je fuie l'hôtel où je réside pour me réfugier chez Starbusck plutôt que d'apprécier la générosité et l'abondance du petit déjeuner de l'hôtel... Domage car l'hôtel est parfaitement géré, le personnel très professionnellent formé (un point spécial à l'exceptionnel personnel de conciergerie) et l'entretien et la maintenance d'un rare niveau de qualité.

They upgraded my room so I decided to write a review haha. This is the best hotel that everyone in Korea knows about, with service and facilities that match its reputation. The staff are friendly (even though I checked in late, I still got a room upgrade) and the interior design turns the old into vintage, but it's not outdated at all. During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip. Even if there are many new and good hotels, Shilla is definitely the best in Jeju. I plan to go again next year... I need to make more money...",Stayed 2 nights in November 2023

During the room change, the female staff member who helped us was very kind and helpful. Unfortunately, we couldn't see her name because her jacket was covering it. She was really great! All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new.

"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

Parking space is unbelievably too tight, there is no room to open either passenger or driver doors. The space that was meant to be for two cars, they split into three.

This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

"By far the best hotel I've stayed.”
Comfort, facilities and luxurious.
This is by far the best hotel I've stayed in my life. I've booked for 3 ocean view rooms for 2 nights. I never wanted to leave the hotel. The bed was perfect and bathroom was compatibly awesome. The view is priceless, especially in the morning. They could've hired a better live band though, but the overall concept of this hotel is just pure luxury. Don't forget to check out the camping site while you're there. Though it's leaning on the pricey side, this is the kind of hotel that is worth the try and money. Go for it, you won't regret.",Stayed 2 nights in June 2014

"Discriminated hotel policy... expensive but nice”
Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all. I feel offended and robbed as the experience is not at all in line with the expectation the name Shilla is brining. Overall, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the same area which might offered better values.",Stayed 1 night in March 2014
"Luxury Hotel but still not worth of Money”
Friendly Staff, Elegant Lobby, and Nice Swimming Pools
It was relaxing and nice. The hotel is expensive and upscale. We have not used any facilities but had their breakfast buffet as everyone was praising about their breakfast. The food was good quality but we were disappointed with the food selection. I still thinks it is not worth of money, comparing to other hotels in Jeju.",Stayed 1 night in January 2014

"Enjoyed the beach”
Private beach, airport shuttle, proximity to local restaurants and shops

Everything was great! It was delightful stay. But the mountain view was actually like car park view, so we had to upgrade our room to ocean view. Except this everything was good as thier reputation.

Glamping BBQ is a must try
Beautiful manicured gardens probably larger than the hotel itself. Lovely for evening walks and a gorgeous view of the sea from the edge of the garden. The swimming pool area is full of constant activities late into the night with salsa dances and suprano singers entertaining guests at all times Rooms were clean and spacious. Embodies rest and relax, definitely does not feel as commercial as some other resorts along the same strip. Pricey but definitely the best resort to stay in jeju.",Stayed 3 nights in September 2012

Heated indoor and outdoor pool, multiple jacuzzi, modern fitness center, centrally located.
It was a pleasure to stay at this hotel. I received a complimentary upgrade to one of the newer rooms in the new addition to the hotel.

I would easily stay here again if finding my way through Jeju island.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2012

Very comfortable room and beautiful garden
The hotel grounds are well taken care of. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The location is far away from the central but right on the beach.

The grounds are inter-linked to Lotte Hotel, which is great as it offers the guests more choices in terms of venues to eat.",Stayed 1 night in October 2012

Amenities
When we first arrived, we had the ""wow"" type of welcome from the reception. But as we move to our rooms, we were a bit disappointed. Didn't had the ""wow"" effect when we first walked in to the room. In fact, it looked ordinary and very wooden. Definitely not worth the price plus the fact that I paid about $ per night with no breakfast! Bed was hard. They provided enough pillows. Free wifi. We booked this hotel thinking of renting a car, but realised that need international license to rent, ended up we did not rent any car and we became not very mobile.",Stayed 2 nights in April 2012

well they have good service in general, and room is pretty clean, i love the little gift such like a box of pencil from them, seems pretty warm. however, i have to point out that 1. room service sucks,house keeping opened my door without my permission for two times to check if i'm in the room!! thats so rude! i know i should check out on time, but is just not polite to open the door when i was still in the room and i already told her i will check out in 5 mins! 2. hotel is too far away from the city center. 3. compare with other hotels, this hotel absolutely sucks! room is soo small and no english channel in tv! no hbo! i was really disappointed! btw, mountain view sucks.. don't live in a mountain view room, trust me....",Stayed 2 nights in January 2012

Bel établissement. Immense. Service impeccable. Maintenance parfaite. Mais prestations hors de prix et besoin de rénovation car hold fashion. Le petit déjeuner à 49,000 KRW (330 HKD, 295 RMB, 38 EUR ou 42 USD) ne passe pas... Un petit déjeuner plus cher que dans le plus cher des Four Seasons me semble tout simplement être abusif. Suffisamment pour m'avoir enlever l'envie d'utiliser les prestations de l'hôtel. L'effet marketing à l'envers. Je crois que c'est la première fois de ma vie où je fuie l'hôtel où je réside pour me réfugier chez Starbusck plutôt que d'apprécier la générosité et l'abondance du petit déjeuner de l'hôtel... Domage car l'hôtel est parfaitement géré, le personnel très professionnellent formé (un point spécial à l'exceptionnel personnel de conciergerie) et l'entretien et la maintenance d'un rare niveau de qualité. La politique de prix est juste d'un autre monde et, jugement de professionnel, d'une autre catégorie d'hôtel. Shilla est un resort de haut de gamme mais t",Stayed 4 nights in October 2019

"Is it necessary to write a review for this hotel?”
They upgraded my room so I decided to write a review haha. This is the best hotel that everyone in Korea knows about, with service and facilities that match its reputation. The staff are friendly (even though I checked in late, I still got a room upgrade) and the interior design turns the old into vintage, but it's not outdated at all. During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip. Even if there are many new and good hotels, Shilla is definitely the best in Jeju. I plan to go again next year... I need to make more money...",Stayed 2 nights in November 2023

During the room change, the female staff member who helped us was very kind and helpful. Unfortunately, we couldn't see her name because her jacket was covering it. She was really great! All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new. We have stayed at Shilla Hotel many times, but we have never seen anyone who was unresponsive. Overall, we are satisfied and will come back again!",Stayed 1 night in November 2023

"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

Parking space is unbelievably too tight, there is no room to open either passenger or driver doors. The space that was meant to be for two cars, they split into three.

"Caveat Emptor!”
This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

INTERIOR, STAFF PERFORMANCE, HIGH CLASS
If you want to stay in Jeju for very special holiday, Shilla will be the best choice. Of course it costs a lot but your time in this hotle will be invaluable.

This is by far the best hotel I've stayed in my life. I've booked for 3 ocean view rooms for 2 nights. I never wanted to leave the hotel. The bed was perfect and bathroom was compatibly awesome. The view is priceless, especially in the morning. They could've hired a better live band though, but the overall concept of this hotel is just pure luxury. Don't forget to check out the camping site while you're there. Though it's leaning on the pricey side, this is the kind of hotel that is worth the try and money.

"Discriminated hotel policy... expensive but nice”
Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all. I feel offended and robbed as the experience is not at all in line with the expectation the name Shilla is brining. Overall, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the same area which might offered better values.",Stayed 1 night in March 2014

Definitely not worth the price plus the fact that I paid about $ per night with no breakfast! Bed was hard. They provided enough pillows. Free wifi.

Le petit déjeuner à 49,000 KRW (330 HKD, 295 RMB, 38 EUR ou 42 USD) ne passe pas... Un petit déjeuner plus cher que dans le plus cher des Four Seasons me semble tout simplement être abusif. Suffisamment pour m'avoir enlever l'envie d'utiliser les prestations de l'hôtel. L'effet marketing à l'envers. Je crois que c'est la première fois de ma vie où je fuie l'hôtel où je réside pour me réfugier chez Starbusck plutôt que d'apprécier la générosité et l'abondance du petit déjeuner de l'hôtel... Domage car l'hôtel est parfaitement géré, le personnel très professionnellent formé (un point spécial à l'exceptionnel personnel de conciergerie) et l'entretien et la maintenance d'un rare niveau de qualité.

During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip.

All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new.

"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

"Caveat Emptor!”
This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

Comfort, facilities and luxurious.
This is by far the best hotel I've stayed in my life. I've booked for 3 ocean view rooms for 2 nights. I never wanted to leave the hotel. The bed was perfect and bathroom was compatibly awesome. The view is priceless, especially in the morning. They could've hired a better live band though, but the overall concept of this hotel is just pure luxury. Don't forget to check out the camping site while you're there. Though it's leaning on the pricey side, this is the kind of hotel that is worth the try and money.

"Discriminated hotel policy... expensive but nice”
Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all. I feel offended and robbed as the experience is not at all in line with the expectation the name Shilla is brining. Overall, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the same area which might offered better values.",Stayed 1 night in March 2014

It was relaxing and nice. The hotel is expensive and upscale. We have not used any facilities but had their breakfast buffet as everyone was praising about their breakfast.

Definitely not worth the price plus the fact that I paid about $ per night with no breakfast! Bed was hard. They provided enough pillows. Free wifi.

Suffisamment pour m'avoir enlever l'envie d'utiliser les prestations de l'hôtel. L'effet marketing à l'envers. Je crois que c'est la première fois de ma vie où je fuie l'hôtel où je réside pour me réfugier chez Starbusck plutôt que d'apprécier la générosité et l'abondance du petit déjeuner de l'hôtel... Domage car l'hôtel est parfaitement géré, le personnel très professionnellent formé (un point spécial à l'exceptionnel personnel de conciergerie) et l'entretien et la maintenance d'un rare niveau de qualité.

During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip.

All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new.

"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

But I’d rather use other near hotels which Has similar spa pools and restaurants and cheaper price.",Stayed 2 nights in December 2020
"Had a blast!”
Pros: Heated pool, live band by the pool, beautiful landscape on a small cliff over Jungnum beach, peaceful, helpful staff, big room. Cons: Need a funny registration process at the Fitness Counter to use the adult pool. We didn’t know so had to walk back from the pool to the hotel to register before walking back out to the adult pool.",Stayed 1 night in December 2019

Samsung runs four hotels under the Shilla name. As beautiful as the main interiors were, there were major issues. The hallways smelled like moldy straw all the time (4 nights) we were there. The beds were uncomfortable. Food/drinks were very expensive--French fries cost about $36 and my mojito $26 served at the indoor/outdoor pool filled with very young children (pee & poo pool).

"Caveat Emptor!”
This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

This is by far the best hotel I've stayed in my life. I've booked for 3 ocean view rooms for 2 nights. I never wanted to leave the hotel. The bed was perfect and bathroom was compatibly awesome. The view is priceless, especially in the morning. They could've hired a better live band though, but the overall concept of this hotel is just pure luxury. Don't forget to check out the camping site while you're there. Though it's leaning on the pricey side, this is the kind of hotel that is worth the try and money.

"Discriminated hotel policy... expensive but nice”
Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all. I feel offended and robbed as the experience is not at all in line with the expectation the name Shilla is brining. Overall, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the same area which might offered better values.",Stayed 1 night in March 2014

During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip.

During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

"Not worth the valuer”
Parking space is unbelievably too tight, there is no room to open either passenger or driver doors. The space that was meant to be for two cars, they split into three. The room furniture shows age but otherwise in decent shape. Dining/restaurant is not worth the price but average enough if you really dont have other options.

Shilla Jeju hotel has a nice swimming pool and well maintained. However, the room was old fashioned and the price of the room is ripped off as considering of the condition.

Samsung runs four hotels under the Shilla name. As beautiful as the main interiors were, there were major issues. The hallways smelled like moldy straw all the time (4 nights) we were there. The beds were uncomfortable. Food/drinks were very expensive--French fries cost about $36 and my mojito $26 served at the indoor/outdoor pool filled with very young children (pee & poo pool).

"Caveat Emptor!”
This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

This is by far the best hotel I've stayed in my life. I've booked for 3 ocean view rooms for 2 nights. I never wanted to leave the hotel. The bed was perfect and bathroom was compatibly awesome. The view is priceless, especially in the morning. They could've hired a better live band though, but the overall concept of this hotel is just pure luxury. Don't forget to check out the camping site while you're there. Though it's leaning on the pricey side, this is the kind of hotel that is worth the try and money.

"Discriminated hotel policy... expensive but nice”
Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all. I feel offended and robbed as the experience is not at all in line with the expectation the name Shilla is brining. Overall, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in the same area which might offered better values.",Stayed 1 night in March 2014

They upgraded my room so I decided to write a review haha. This is the best hotel that everyone in Korea knows about, with service and facilities that match its reputation.

During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip.

All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new. We have stayed at Shilla Hotel many times, but we have never seen anyone who was unresponsive. Overall, we are satisfied and will come back again!",Stayed 1 night in November 2023
"Exellent Location & Service”
We stayed at Shilla Jeju for 3 days. The location is excellent, they have many restaurants and shops near by, easy and free parking on site. Also the staff at the hotel provides excellent services. This property is really big, has adult only pool, hiking course along the cliff with amazing ocean view, gramping site and more! Highly recommend this hotel!",Stayed 3 nights in October 2023
"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

The best hotel in the area if not the entirety of Jeju. Even as a Korean this was a mindblowing hotel. Loved the garden and seafront walkway especially.

Parking space is unbelievably too tight, there is no room to open either passenger or driver doors. The space that was meant to be for two cars, they split into three. The room furniture shows age but otherwise in decent shape. Dining/restaurant is not worth the price but average enough if you really dont have other options.

Shilla Jeju hotel has a nice swimming pool and well maintained. However, the room was old fashioned and the price of the room is ripped off as considering of the condition.

Samsung runs four hotels under the Shilla name. As beautiful as the main interiors were, there were major issues. The hallways smelled like moldy straw all the time (4 nights) we were there. The beds were uncomfortable. Food/drinks were very expensive--French fries cost about $36 and my mojito $26 served at the indoor/outdoor pool filled with very young children (pee & poo pool).

"Caveat Emptor!”
This property is very nice, however, there are many caveats that the traveler should be cautioned on. The Good: Beautiful grounds Very nice linen Good wifi Easy check out The Bad: Very limited pool service. Try getting any Food & Beverage. It is a challenge! Towels just lie there, uncollected. No one comes around to check on guest needs. Very limited facilities outside the property. You are forced to eat in the hotel unless you choose to take a cab ride. Staff are very green and need enhanced training. Limited English language skills Mediocre beach front The Ugly!! Food and Beverage pricing is EXTREMELY expensive, bordering on gouging. A fruit plate is $60 ! Same as a cheese plate - US$60. (good luck trying to get some bread or crackers to go with that cheese!!) There is NO a la carte breakfast option. Buffet is at US$42/per person The mark of a satisfactory stay is if one would revisit the property. I can't say I would",Stayed 4 nights in August 2016
"Worth the expense”
I do not usually stay in high-end resorts so this was quite a treat for me. From the moment we arrived until our final farewells, it was a pleasure living in and around the Shilla for our long 4th of July weekend. We especially enjoyed the quiet adult pool. Our last night there we sat at the pool and had the lifeguard order dinner brought up to us. What a treat! There was high quality live music at the lower pool every night. Many interesting paved paths around the grounds including a beautiful one down to the beach. The landscaping was excellent. One of our favorite features as non-Korean speakers was the concierge. There were three of them so no waiting. She set up dinners, taxis, and answered all of our tourist questions in perfect English. It was really hard to leave and come back to the real world. Lest you think the place was totally perfect, I must mention that the parking was terrible. The lot was full and cars were parked all along the curbs. There just didn't seem to be enough parking. Since I didn't have a car it didn't bother me much. I hope to return for another visit soon.",Stayed 3 nights in July 2016

The view is priceless, especially in the morning. They could've hired a better live band though, but the overall concept of this hotel is just pure luxury.

"Discriminated hotel policy... expensive but nice”
Pool, restaurants, view
We decided to go stay at The Shilla for our quick getaway to celebrate, and it is a great place to stay. nice scenery, nice amenities, close to the beach. Room in itself was a disappointment. Nice decoration, old fashion (and simply old) furniture. Nice balcony. Oldest room electronics I have seen since I have been travelling on business . Bathroom was nice decorated, though toilet seat was broken and ALL the plumbery was about 20 years old. No rain shower, no water mixer (still one cold and one hot)... Not acceptable for such a high rated hotel. Dinner was very nice, however it comes as extra with a steep price. Guerlain Spa was just AMAZING, but again comes as a very steep extra price. Pool and jacuzzi (free access) are very nice as you can go from indoor to outdoor by a tunnel. Very clean and amazing. I will never go back to the SHILLA Jeju nor ANY SHILLA at all. I feel offended and robbed as the experience is not at all in line with the expectation the name Shilla is brining.

Definitely not worth the price plus the fact that I paid about $ per night with no breakfast! Bed was hard. They provided enough pillows. Free wifi.

Suffisamment pour m'avoir enlever l'envie d'utiliser les prestations de l'hôtel. L'effet marketing à l'envers. Je crois que c'est la première fois de ma vie où je fuie l'hôtel où je réside pour me réfugier chez Starbusck plutôt que d'apprécier la générosité et l'abondance du petit déjeuner de l'hôtel... Domage car l'hôtel est parfaitement géré, le personnel très professionnellent formé (un point spécial à l'exceptionnel personnel de conciergerie) et l'entretien et la maintenance d'un rare niveau de qualité. La politique de prix est juste d'un autre monde et, jugement de professionnel, d'une autre catégorie d'hôtel. Shilla est un resort de haut de gamme mais t",Stayed 4 nights in October 2019

"期待はずれ”
老舗なりの素敵さはあるけど、建物自体が古いし部屋の作りがぱっとしない。 天候悪くプールは利用しなかったが、パンフレットを見るかぎり色々なものにいちいち料金がかかる。 併設のサウナですら追加料金も必要。 小さい子供連れの韓国ファミリーがほとんどで、がちゃがちゃした雰囲気は否めない。 朝食は種類が多く良かった。 アワビ入りのお粥やチャプチェ等、シーフード系は美味しい。 レストランは3つ＋軽食2つ、朝食のレストランは夕食時はビュッフェとアラカルトがあるが、ビュッフェは大人10900円ほどする。 英語があまり通じないのでコミュニケーションがやや不便。",Stayed 2 nights in October 2018

"Is it necessary to write a review for this hotel?”
They upgraded my room so I decided to write a review haha. This is the best hotel that everyone in Korea knows about, with service and facilities that match its reputation. The staff are friendly (even though I checked in late, I still got a room upgrade) and the interior design turns the old into vintage, but it's not outdated at all. During my stay, I walked around the well-maintained gardens near the hotel after having breakfast, and it was the happiest memory of my Jeju trip. Even if there are many new and good hotels, Shilla is definitely the best in Jeju. I plan to go again next year... I need to make more money...",Stayed 2 nights in November 2023
"As expected, Shilla is Shilla!! Adding the evening view at The Parkview made it completely satisfying.”
During the room change, the female staff member who helped us was very kind and helpful. Unfortunately, we couldn't see her name because her jacket was covering it. She was really great! All the other staff members were also very kind. However, the two women who were in charge of the entrance at The Parkview on November 14th seemed to be new. We have stayed at Shilla Hotel many times, but we have never seen anyone who was unresponsive. Overall, we are satisfied and will come back again!",Stayed 1 night in November 2023
"Exellent Location & Service”
We stayed at Shilla Jeju for 3 days. The location is excellent, they have many restaurants and shops near by, easy and free parking on site. Also the staff at the hotel provides excellent services. This property is really big, has adult only pool, hiking course along the cliff with amazing ocean view, gramping site and more! Highly recommend this hotel!",Stayed 3 nights in October 2023
"""I can understand why many people are looking for it.""”
During my 2-night, 3-day trip to Jeju Island, I chose to stay at the Shilla Hotel. As a hotel that boasts history, tradition, and natural surroundings in the Jungmun Tourist Complex, I was able to comfortably heal and relax. The accommodation was quiet and comfortable, and I slept well. The reason for this was not only because of the clean facilities, but also because of the indescribable comfort. Above all, I recommend this hotel because of the beautiful forest path in front of the hotel, the themed observatory, and the cool tech that connects to the nearby beach. The background is so beautiful that even just taking pictures and walking around could take half a day. I highly recommend this place for families and couples.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2023

The best hotel in the area if not the entirety of Jeju. Even as a Korean this was a mindblowing hotel. Loved the garden and seafront walkway especially.

Parking space is unbelievably too tight, there is no room to open either passenger or driver doors. The space that was meant to be for two cars, they split into three. The room furniture shows age but otherwise in decent shape. Dining/restaurant is not worth the price but average enough if you really dont have other options.

Shilla Jeju hotel has a nice swimming pool and well maintained. However, the room was old fashioned and the price of the room is ripped off as considering of the condition.

Samsung runs four hotels under the Shilla name. As beautiful as the main interiors were, there were major issues. The hallways smelled like moldy straw all the time (4 nights) we were there.

Since I had two rooms for 5 nights. I had to pay $1,000 additionally, which made the room charge $450 per night. I can get much cleaner rooms at fraction of the cost at othe hotels. I always stayed at Shilla whenever I come to Korea, whether it be Jeju or Seoul. But This will be my last time until Shilla updates the rooms. Not worth the money for 5 star hotels.

However, rooms are outdated and carpets are dirty and walls and doors are old and not upto par of the overall hotel image. The rooms smell!! There are old and new building. Rooms in new building are relatively clean and nice. But rooms in old building quite different. I had to ask to move to rooms in new building. I had to pay $100 surcharge per night per room. Since I had two rooms for 5 nights. I had to pay $1,000 additionally, which made the room charge $450 per night. I can get much cleaner rooms at fraction of the cost at othe hotels. I always stayed at Shilla whenever I come to Korea, whether it be Jeju or Seoul. But This will be my last time until Shilla updates the rooms. Not worth the money for 5 star hotels. Rooms in old building are that of 3 star hotels. Old building still makes up 70% of the entire hotels.",Stayed 5 nights in October 2016

The Shilla Hotel WAS my favorite place to stay. The lobby and common area are still fabulous and staffs are friendly and restaurants serve good food. However, rooms are outdated and carpets are dirty and walls and doors are old and not upto par of the overall hotel image. The rooms smell!! There are old and new building. Rooms in new building are relatively clean and nice. But rooms in old building quite different. I had to ask to move to rooms in new building. I had to pay $100 surcharge per night per room. Since I had two rooms for 5 nights. I had to pay $1,000 additionally, which made the room charge $450 per night. I can get much cleaner rooms at fraction of the cost at othe hotels. I always stayed at Shilla whenever I come to Korea, whether it be Jeju or Seoul. But This will be my last time until Shilla updates the rooms. Not worth the money for 5 star hotels. Rooms in old building are that of 3 star hotels. Old building still makes up 70% of the entire hotels.",Stayed 5 nights in October 2016

"The hotel rooms update is way over due.”
The Shilla Hotel WAS my favorite place to stay. The lobby and common area are still fabulous and staffs are friendly and restaurants serve good food. However, rooms are outdated and carpets are dirty and walls and doors are old and not upto par of the overall hotel image. The rooms smell!! There are old and new building. Rooms in new building are relatively clean and nice. But rooms in old building quite different. I had to ask to move to rooms in new building. I had to pay $100 surcharge per night per room. Since I had two rooms for 5 nights. I had to pay $1,000 additionally, which made the room charge $450 per night. I can get much cleaner rooms at fraction of the cost at othe hotels. I always stayed at Shilla whenever I come to Korea, whether it be Jeju or Seoul. But This will be my last time until Shilla updates the rooms. Not worth the money for 5 star hotels. Rooms in old building are that of 3 star hotels. Old building still makes up 70% of the entire hotels.",Stayed 5 nights in October 2016

The Shilla Hotel WAS my favorite place to stay. The lobby and common area are still fabulous and staffs are friendly and restaurants serve good food. However, rooms are outdated and carpets are dirty and walls and doors are old and not upto par of the overall hotel image. The rooms smell!! There are old and new building. Rooms in new building are relatively clean and nice. But rooms in old building quite different. I had to ask to move to rooms in new building. I had to pay $100 surcharge per night per room. Since I had two rooms for 5 nights. I had to pay $1,000 additionally, which made the room charge $450 per night. I can get much cleaner rooms at fraction of the cost at othe hotels. I always stayed at Shilla whenever I come to Korea, whether it be Jeju or Seoul. But This will be my last time until Shilla updates the rooms. Not worth the money for 5 star hotels. Rooms in old building are that of 3 star hotels. Old building still makes up 70% of the entire hotels.",Stayed 5 nights in October 2016

"The hotel rooms update is way over due.”
The Shilla Hotel WAS my favorite place to stay. The lobby and common area are still fabulous and staffs are friendly and restaurants serve good food. However, rooms are outdated and carpets are dirty and walls and doors are old and not upto par of the overall hotel image. The rooms smell!! There are old and new building. Rooms in new building are relatively clean and nice. But rooms in old building quite different. I had to ask to move to rooms in new building. I had to pay $100 surcharge per night per room. Since I had two rooms for 5 nights. I had to pay $1,000 additionally, which made the room charge $450 per night. I can get much cleaner rooms at fraction of the cost at othe hotels. I always stayed at Shilla whenever I come to Korea, whether it be Jeju or Seoul. But This will be my last time until Shilla updates the rooms. Not worth the money for 5 star hotels. Rooms in old building are that of 3 star hotels. Old building still makes up 70% of the entire hotels.",Stayed 5 nights in October 2016

The Shilla Hotel WAS my favorite place to stay. The lobby and common area are still fabulous and staffs are friendly and restaurants serve good food. However, rooms are outdated and carpets are dirty and walls and doors are old and not upto par of the overall hotel image. The rooms smell!! There are old and new building. Rooms in new building are relatively clean and nice. But rooms in old building quite different. I had to ask to move to rooms in new building. I had to pay $100 surcharge per night per room. Since I had two rooms for 5 nights. I had to pay $1,000 additionally, which made the room charge $450 per night. I can get much cleaner rooms at fraction of the cost at othe hotels. I always stayed at Shilla whenever I come to Korea, whether it be Jeju or Seoul. But This will be my last time until Shilla updates the rooms. Not worth the money for 5 star hotels. Rooms in old building are that of 3 star hotels. Old building still makes up 70% of the entire hotels.",Stayed 5 nights in October 2016

"The hotel rooms update is way over due.”
The Shilla Hotel WAS my favorite place to stay. The lobby and common area are still fabulous and staffs are friendly and restaurants serve good food. However, rooms are outdated and carpets are dirty and walls and doors are old and not upto par of the overall hotel image. The rooms smell!! There are old and new building. Rooms in new building are relatively clean and nice. But rooms in old building quite different. I had to ask to move to rooms in new building. I had to pay $100 surcharge per night per room. Since I had two rooms for 5 nights. I had to pay $1,000 additionally, which made the room charge $450 per night. I can get much cleaner rooms at fraction of the cost at othe hotels. I always stayed at Shilla whenever I come to Korea, whether it be Jeju or Seoul. But This will be my last time until Shilla updates the rooms. Not worth the money for 5 star hotels. Rooms in old building are that of 3 star hotels. Old building still makes up 70% of the entire hotels.",Stayed 5 nights in October 2016

Make you feel great once you arrived the front door. No need to stand in front of the front desk for check in. Instead you were led to sit comfortable with a glass of orange juice during the process of checking in.",Stayed 2 nights in October 2016
"The hotel rooms update is way over due.”
The Shilla Hotel WAS my favorite place to stay. The lobby and common area are still fabulous and staffs are friendly and restaurants serve good food. However, rooms are outdated and carpets are dirty and walls and doors are old and not upto par of the overall hotel image. The rooms smell!! There are old and new building. Rooms in new building are relatively clean and nice. But rooms in old building quite different. I had to ask to move to rooms in new building. I had to pay $100 surcharge per night per room. Since I had two rooms for 5 nights. I had to pay $1,000 additionally, which made the room charge $450 per night. I can get much cleaner rooms at fraction of the cost at othe hotels. I always stayed at Shilla whenever I come to Korea, whether it be Jeju or Seoul. But This will be my last time until Shilla updates the rooms. Not worth the money for 5 star hotels. Rooms in old building are that of 3 star hotels. Old building still makes up 70% of the entire hotels.",Stayed 5 nights in October 2016
"Hotel with great children facilities”
This hotel is a resort that allows us to visit the sites in Jeju while coming back to a very comfortable environment to enjoy our family vacation",Stayed 3 nights in June 2016
